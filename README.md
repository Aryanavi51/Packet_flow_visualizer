#Packet Flow Visualizer Project
#Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to create a visual representation of the packet flow from students' laptops/desktops (hosts) to external networks outside of the college campus. The project can be divided into two key parts:

Network Topology Creation: In this phase, students will determine the devices present within the college network by using tools like traceroute or consulting with the college network administrator. Based on the gathered information, students will create a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The topology will illustrate the various network devices, their connections, and the path from the host to the external network.

Packet Flow Investigation: After establishing the network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer and configuring IPv4 addresses on all layer-3 devices, students will collect packets at each device using a packet sniffer. They can use the built-in sniffer in Cisco Packet Tracer for this purpose. By analyzing the packets captured from different devices (nodes), students can extract relevant information from the packet headers, particularly noting changes occurring in the Ethernet and IP headers. This data will enable them to create a flow diagram illustrating the path of the packet flow from their device (host) to the external network.
